    <h3>Brief History</h3>
        <p>BeautifulNepal is a land of friendly and engaging people, where deities mingle with mortals and magnificent temples, monasteries and historical monuments can be found at almost every turn. This is the home of Sagarmatha “Goddess Mother of the World”, the iconic Mount Everest, and her snow-capped counterparts making up the weather-beaten Himalayas.</p>
        <p>From eight of the fourteen tallest mountains in the world to the flourishing Terai plains of Jhapa, you will be forgiven for having your camera glued to your hands at all times. To take in the wonders of the Himalayas, we recommend travelling to Dhulikhel , one of the most popular destinations to view this chain of giants. Nepal’s startling beauty is at its best in Pokhara , which has been the subject of many travel writers. Its pristine air, the spectacular backdrop of the snowy peaks of the Annapurna Range and the serene Phewa, Begnas and Rupa Lakes, makes this destination ‘the Jewel of the Himalaya’.</p>
        <p>For a walk on the wild side we suggest a Nepal tour to the Chitwan National Park . Chitwan translates to “heart of the jungle” and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The park is home to many endangered animals such as the one-horned rhino, royal Bengal tiger, gharial crocodile and fresh water gangetic dolphin. The Bardia National Park is the largest wildlife area in the Terai and protects 968 square kilometres of sal forest and grassland, including one of Asia’s largest stretches of tiger habitat.</p>
        <p>A Nepal tour wouldn’t be complete without exploring the fascinating Kathmandu Valley . Comprising of the three ancient cities of Kathmandu, Patan and Bhaktapur, the valley houses seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is also home to a myriad of monuments, sculptures, artistic temples and magnificent artworks.</p>
        <p>Be sure to visit Kathmandu’s Durbar Square (the historic seat of royalty), home to the Hanuman Dhoka, named after the monkey god, Hanuman. Follow this exploration with a stop at the Patan Durbar Square, which is located in the heart of Patan City and consists of three main chowks (squares). The Sundari Chowk holds a masterpiece of stone architecture, the Royal Bath called Tushahity, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Monument.</p>
        <p>Adventure tourism is one of Nepal’s biggest drawcards. This is the ideal destination for active travellers, offering activities for nature lovers and adrenaline seekers. While trekking, mountaineering and game viewing have long been popular, visitors can now also enjoy excursions such as rafting, biking, fishing, hot air ballooning and even bungee jumping.</p>
        
        <h3>Why Visit?</h3>
        <p>Nepalis a country of contrasts. Spectacular natural riches combine with a vibrant culture and sense of history. Home to ten of the world’s 14 highest mountains, the country offers a magnificent setting for hiking and mountaineering, as well as some of the world’s best white water rafting.</p>
        <p>With its vast range of altitudes, Nepal is also home to an incredible variety of plant and animal species, including more than 300 species of orchid. With over 800 bird varieties, it accounts for almost 10% of the world’s avian species.</p>
        <p>The diverse national parks of Chitwan and Bardia encompass lowland tropical jungles and grasslands and Nepal shelters a rich variety of wildlife.The Bengal tiger, rare snow leopard, one-horned rhino and the Himalayan black bear can be seen in the remote national parks.</p>
        <p>The ancient culture and traditional architecture of Kathmandu means that the city boasts no less than seven World Heritage Sites, while Nepal is famous for its scenic monasteries as well as being home to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Lord Buddha.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of accommodation can be found, however, what we recommend and use are the award-winning property mostly in the five-star category. It is strongly recommended that you reserve all your accommodation as far in advance as possible, especially if you want to travel during their festival period.</p>

        <p>Nepal is a wonderful, family-friendly destination, offering a range of activities for children such as tailored wildlife safaris, rafting, nature hikes and cultural excursions.</p>
